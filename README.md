## 🔍 Project: Structuring Insights from the DBLP Citation Network (V17)
📊 Role: Data Analyst | Tools: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Jupyter Notebook`

I recently worked with the DBLP-Citation-network-V17 dataset, a large-scale bibliographic dataset with over 9 million research records. The goal was to transform unstructured citation data into structured formats and unlock hidden patterns through feature engineering.

✅ Key Achievements:

✔Transformed 9M+ unstructured JSONL records into clean, structured CSVs using Python—streamlining downstream analytics workflows

✔Achieved a 70% reduction in dataset size by eliminating duplicates and ~1M incomplete records, improving performance and quality

✔Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis on authorship patterns, uncovering trends in co-author networks, publication frequency, and classification

✔Engineered new features from author names and IDs, enabling deeper segmentation and the potential for author profiling and citation forecasting

This project strengthened my data wrangling, EDA, and pipeline optimization capabilities—while reinforcing the value of clean, structured data for strategic academic and organizational insights.

📈 Excited to build on this with graph-based analysis, trend modeling, or dashboarding solutions.
